# sorting-algorithms
A repository to implement sorting algorithms for learning purposes only. Codes here will be mostly from textbooks and public references.

The inspiration to create this repository is a course taught by Elemar Jr, from Eximia.co, a Brazilian tech company, on algorithms and data structures. Another goal is to try new topics, tools and other stuff that add value to my career as developer / metallurgist.
